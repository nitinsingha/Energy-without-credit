This is the repository for double auction method code

doubleauction.m contains the incomplete code shown on the meeting on 14th April
driver.m, problemA.m, problemEB.m, problemES.m are the newly written files for double auction method; all variables and initialisations have to be done in driver.m
running driver.m then implements the double auction algorithm
