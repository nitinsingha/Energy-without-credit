This is the repository for double auction method code

driver.m, problemA.m, problemEB.m, problemES.m, socialWelfare.m, avgPayment.m, avgReward.m are the newly written files for double auction method; all variables and initialisations have to be done in driver.m
running driver.m then implements the double auction algorithm
